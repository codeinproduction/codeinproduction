# codeinproduction

Hello and Welcome!

Code In Production is a hub for, wait for it...., code that's in production.

# Why?

As a newbie to the world of development, I found that all of the training, courses, tutorials and articles were very helpful in building a foundation. However, I learned A LOT by spending countless hours on GitHub reading code. Most of it was from OSS projects, so it helped a lot in understanding patterns and structure for the functionality needed to power most of what one would like to build. But, there came a time when I was ready to work on sites/apps for production and realized I hadn't really seen (or was aware that I've seen) any examples of code that has been battle tested. Obviously, one could write the code based on the knowledge they've gathered and put it out there and deal with bugs as they come. Let's be clear, this project isn't going to prevent anyone from ever having to do that. Instead, the goal is to help folks have to do it less, you know, the whole not re-inventing the wheel thing.

# What We're Looking For
The focus here is to gather code for people to read and review the commit history to see where fixes were made.

1. Repo's of websites, web apps, XaaS' that are OSS and actively being used in production
2. Articles about what you've learned since pushing a site / product / project to production (the focus is mostly on FIXING but if you cover preventative measures taken during the building process that is helpful)
3. YouTube streams of troubleshooting code that is being used in production
4. If you think something fits the bill but it doesn't fall under 1-3, send it anyways and we'll review it!

# How to Submit
Follow the instructions below or make a good ole' pull request
1. Must include the programming language
2. Must include the appropriate category - Repo, Article, Video, Other
3. Must be a link to the main page of the repository (Github and Gitlab are welcome)
4. Can optionally include a write up of major bumps in the road you encountered or things to look out for 

If submission is an article, please include what language(s) it is available in.
